# Getting And Cleaning Data Project: Wearable Computing

Wearable computing has become a popular topic of discussion in the data science world. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. In this repository, you will find data that has been collected, cleaned, and manipulated to yield averages in a tidy data set.

This repository includes:

* `README.md` - A summary of the data and background information about the purpose of this project
* `CODEBOOK.md` - A codebook that indicates all of the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and other relevant information
* `run_analysis.R` - A R script that gathers and cleans the original data set given
